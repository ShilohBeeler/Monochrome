# MONOCHROME

This is my second major personal project, with the first being my [discordRPG](https://github.com/Shymain/discordRPG) project from a couple years back. This project is intended to be a Visual Novel engine and front-end, developed fully in Java. This serves three purposes: First, it's a good representation of the work I've done across the past semester in Java. Secondly, it seems like a fun endeavor. And finally, I'd really like to be able to make short stories into a more engaging format, since I love to write.
